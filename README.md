- 🚗 Optimize Product & Vehicle Strategy by visualizing sales trends over time.  
- ⚙️ Enhance Operational Efficiency by analyzing the distribution of sales statuses.  
- 💡 Enable Data-Driven Decisions with dynamic, real-time filtering and reporting.

## 🛠️ Dashboard Architecture

  Cross-filtering enabled for deep-dive analysis.  
  Designed for easy export and sharing of reports.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **BI Platform:** Microsoft Power BI Desktop  
- **Data Transformation:** Power Query (M Language)  
- **Calculations & Measures:** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
- **Data Source:** Flat files (e.g., CSV, Excel) or database connectors

## 📊 Interactive Dashboard Features

1. **Executive KPI Overview**  
   - Total Sales: Real-time sum of revenue (e.g., 10M).  
   - Global Reach: Counts of active countries (19) and cities (73).  
   - Clear, immediate view of top-level business health.

2. **Geospatial & Status Analysis**  
   - Sales by Country (Bar Chart & Treemap): Instantly identify market leaders like the USA (>3M in sales).  
   - Sales by Status (Bar Chart): Understand the sales funnel, highlighting dominant statuses like "Shipped."

3. **Temporal & Product Insights**  
   - Sales Trend by Year (Line Chart): Track performance fluctuations and growth patterns for different vehicle types.  
   - Dynamic Slicers: Filter the entire dashboard by Year, Country, Vehicle Type, and Status for granular analysis.

## 📌 Key Insights

- 🧾 Market Dominance: The USA is the primary revenue driver, contributing over 3M to total sales.  
- ✅ Operational Flow: The "Shipped" status accounts for the vast majority of sales, indicating a healthy fulfillment process.  
- 🚗 Product Performance: Vehicle sales show distinct trends year-over-year, allowing for targeted marketing.  
- 🌍 Regional Concentration: Sales are concentrated in a key set of 19 countries, suggesting focused expansion opportunities.

## 📈 Strategic Recommendations

- Double Down on Top Markets: Allocate additional marketing and sales resources to the USA and other high-performing countries.  
- Investigate Bottlenecks: Analyze orders with "On Hold" or "Cancelled" statuses to identify and resolve process inefficiencies.  
- Launch Targeted Campaigns: Use yearly trend data to create vehicle-specific promotions during peak buying seasons.  
- Optimize Inventory: Align stock levels with the most frequently shipped vehicle types and locations.

1. Install Microsoft Power BI Desktop.  
2. Download the project files, including the `.pbix` report and the `data` folder.  
3. Open the `Sales Dashboard by Country.pbix` file.  
4. Refresh the data if prompted, ensuring the data source path is correctly linked to the `sales_data.csv` file.

## 🌍 Cross-Industry Use Cases
